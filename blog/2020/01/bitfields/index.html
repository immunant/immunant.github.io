                <h2 id="what-are-bitfields">What Are Bitfields?</h2>
<p>The C programming language is a product of a time where it was important to use as
few resoures as possible. Memory was measured in kilobytes rather than gigabytes as we do today. Bitfields offer a handy way to reduce memory usage. However, bitfields aren&rsquo;t just a relic of yesteryear&rsquo;s computer programming; they remain frequently used today.
Some domains, like embedded hardware, still require programmers to be frugal with memory. Projects like Nginx as well as many Linux kernel modules also reduce memory usage this way. Moreover, some
hardware interfaces expect bits to be laid out in a particular format.</p>
<p>So, how do bitfields actually work? The idea is that if you have multiple integers values you
have to keep track of but know that they wouldn&rsquo;t use all possible values in the integer type,
you can compact them together by assigning a maximum bit size to the integer. For example,
suppose we&rsquo;d like to write a very contrived compact date <code>struct</code> in C:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">struct Date {
    unsigned char day: 5;
    unsigned char month: 4;
    signed short year: 15;
} __attribute__((packed));
</code></pre>
<p>We use 5 bits of space for <code>day</code> because that&rsquo;s the minimum size (<code>2 ^ 5 = 32</code>) to store the largest
number of days in any given month (31). Similarly, we give <code>month</code> 4 bits to minimally represent
12 months. Finally, we give <code>year</code> enough bits to be able to represent the current year
(and then some!) and make it signed to signify the era. This should give us a nice three-byte
<code>struct</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Clang can helpfully confirm our <code>struct</code> is laid out as expected:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">clang -Xclang -fdump-record-layouts date.c
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-C">*** Dumping AST Record Layout
     0 | struct Date
 0:0-4 |   unsigned char day
 0:5-8 |   unsigned char month
1:1-15 |   signed short year
       | [sizeof=3, align=1]
</code></pre>
<p>The bitfields <code>day</code> and <code>month</code> share the first byte, but the last bit of <code>month</code> straddles the
second byte followed by <code>year</code> taking up the remainder of the last two bytes.</p>
<h2 id="translation-requirements">Translation Requirements</h2>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust">C2Rust</a> is to translate any standard C code into Rust. To translate bitfields from C, we therefore
require drop-in compatible bitfield support. Since the Rust ecosystem revolves around sharing
code in libraries (called crates), we decided to look at the few most promising crates to see what was
available. Unfortunately, we found that not all of them provided byte compatibility with equivalent C
structures which C2Rust must ensure so that its output is FFI compatible with the original C
input. Section 6.7.2.1 of the C standard states that you cannot take pointers to bitfields. This is
because pointers can only refer to whole bytes, not individual bits. However, since a <code>struct</code> may
contain a mix of bitfields and non-bitfields, we must still be able to take pointers (and references)
to non-bitfield fields. Although a softer requirement, most of the crates did provide an abstraction
layer so that users didn&rsquo;t have to think about or manage bitfield boilerplate directly.</p>
<p>In summary, our crate requirements are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>ABI compatibility with C</li>
<li>Able to take pointers to non-bitfields</li>
<li>Abstraction layer with minimal boilerplate</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an overview of the 3rd party crates we looked at and how they stacked up to our requirements:</p>
<h3 id="the-rust-bitfield-crate">The <code>rust-bitfield</code> Crate</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dzamlo/rust-bitfield">rust-bitfield</a> crate provides a nifty <code>bitfield!</code>
macro_rules macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">bitfield!{
    struct Date(MSB0 [u8]);
    u32;
    get_day, set_day: 4, 0;
    get_month, set_month: 8, 5;
    get_year, set_year: 23, 9;
}

fn main() {
    let mut date = Date([0, 0, 0]);

    date.set_day(7);
    date.set_month(1);
    date.set_year(2020);

    assert_eq!(date.get_day(), 7);
    assert_eq!(date.get_month(), 1);
    assert_eq!(date.get_year(), 2020);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We liked that the bit specification was easy to read and that
you could specify most or least significant bit ordering. However, since the <code>struct</code> must be
backed by a byte array, there are no directly addressible non-bitfield fields, let alone pointers to
them(<code>#2</code>). Another issue we had was that <code>macro_rules!</code> macros are hard to format automatically.
Passing them into our <a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/tree/master/c2rust-refactor">refactoring tool</a>
would cause them to be formatted unexpectedly. This is because the refactorer has to re-print
source code to file and does not know what the expected format of the non-standard macro is. The nice
thing about this approach is that it abstracts the complexity of bitfields behind helper methods(<code>#3</code>).</p>
<h3 id="the-packed_struct-crate">The <code>packed_struct</code> Crate</h3>
<p>The feature-packed <a href="https://github.com/hashmismatch/packed_struct.rs">packed_struct</a> crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">#[derive(PackedStruct)]
#[packed_struct(bit_numbering=&quot;msb0&quot;)]
pub struct Date {
    #[packed_field(bits=&quot;0..=4&quot;)]
    day: u8,
    #[packed_field(bits=&quot;5..=8&quot;)]
    month: u8,
    #[packed_field(bits=&quot;9..=23&quot;, endian=&quot;msb&quot;)]
    year: i16,
}

fn main() {
    let mut date = Date { day: 0, month: 0, year: 0 };

    date.day = 7;
    date.month = 1;
    date.year = 2020;

    assert_eq!(date.day, 7);
    assert_eq!(date.month, 1);
    assert_eq!(date.year, 2020);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We really wanted to use this crate. It seems to have a ton of neat configuration options,
e.g., you can turn bitfields into enums. And more importantly, it uses actual fields rather
than an internal byte representation, unlike <code>rust-bitfield</code>.</p>
<p>A big problem we had with it was
usability. It seems to be <a href="https://github.com/hashmismatch/packed_struct.rs/issues/39">very particular</a>
about the type signatures you provide to it, and the compiler errors weren&rsquo;t that helpful. It took
half an hour to figure out how to get the above example compiling after fiddling around with its <code>Integer</code>
type<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. And we&rsquo;re still not sure why <code>year</code> needs its endianness explicitly specified when the <code>struct</code>
already has a default. This crate may just still require a lot of macro polish.
However, the biggest problem we had with this crate was that the generated <code>struct</code>s are not byte compatible
with their C counterparts(<code>#1</code>). <code>Date</code>, in the above example, is four bytes large! Instead, there&rsquo;s a
helper method to build a correctly sized byte array from scratch. On the plus side, the derive macro
and <code>struct</code> attributes seemed like a great approach in general.</p>
<h3 id="the-bindgen-crate">The <code>bindgen</code> Crate</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> crate emits Rust <code>struct</code>s based on C
code for interoperability and therefore is a bit closer to what we need in <code>C2Rust</code> than the previous two crates.
Running the C date example through bindgen would get you the following, trimmed for brevity:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">#[repr(C)]
pub struct __BindgenBitfieldUnit&lt;Storage, Align&gt; {
    storage: Storage,
    align: [Align; 0],
}
impl&lt;Storage, Align&gt; __BindgenBitfieldUnit&lt;Storage, Align&gt;
where
    Storage: AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt; + AsMut&lt;[u8]&gt;,
{
    pub fn get_bit(&amp;self, index: usize) -&gt; bool {
        // ...
    }
    pub fn set_bit(&amp;mut self, index: usize, val: bool) {
        // ...
    }
    pub fn get(&amp;self, bit_offset: usize, bit_width: u8) -&gt; u64 {
        // ...
    }
    pub fn set(&amp;mut self, bit_offset: usize, bit_width: u8, val: u64) {
        // ...
    }
}
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct Date {
    pub _bitfield_1: __BindgenBitfieldUnit&lt;[u8; 4usize], u16&gt;,
}

impl Date {
    pub fn day(&amp;self) -&gt; ::std::os::raw::c_uchar {
        unsafe { ::std::mem::transmute(self._bitfield_1.get(0usize, 5u8) as u8) }
    }
    pub fn set_day(&amp;mut self, val: ::std::os::raw::c_uchar) {
        unsafe {
            let val: u8 = ::std::mem::transmute(val);
            self._bitfield_1.set(0usize, 5u8, val as u64)
        }
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the amount of boilerplate can quickly balloon(<code>#3</code>). Despite this,
the above is a really neat approach because the <code>align</code> field treats the alignment
as if it were an actual field that can be customized through generics. <code>#1</code> is satisfied
because byte compatability is maintained. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s very clever that consecutive
bitfields are combined into a single byte array. Lastly, <code>#2</code> is satisfied because the
<code>Date</code> <code>struct</code> has concrete fields which could have pointers taken to them if needed.</p>
<h3 id="honorable-mention-the-bitvec-crate">Honorable Mention: The <code>bitvec</code> Crate</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t catch wind of this crate when we first researched existing bitfield support,
so we never did a thorough evaluation of it. It seems to have existed in some capacity at that point,
though. Check out this <a href="https://myrrlyn.net/blog/misc/bitfields-in-rust">blog post</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>It appears to have the same problem as <code>rust-bitfield</code> insofar that bitfields are backed by a byte array.
Therefore it doesn&rsquo;t meet requirement <code>#2</code>. Bits are read in a novel way though. A generic load method reads from
(and another writes to) the backing bytes like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">bitvec[10..23].load::&lt;u16&gt;().unwrap();
</code></pre>
<p>Here the index represents bits, not bytes. A big advantage <code>bitvec</code> does have over <code>rust-bitfield</code>
and <code>packed_struct</code> is that it seems to still be actively developed as of this writing.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach-the-c2rust-bitfields-crate">Our Approach: The <code>c2rust-bitfields</code> Crate</h2>
<p>Learning from the first three of the above crates, we tried to find a middle ground which could satisfy
all of our requirements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">#[repr(C, align(1))]
#[derive(BitfieldStruct)]
struct Date {
    #[bitfield(name = &quot;day&quot;, ty = &quot;libc::c_uchar&quot;, bits = &quot;0..=4&quot;)]
    #[bitfield(name = &quot;month&quot;, ty = &quot;libc::c_uchar&quot;, bits = &quot;5..=8&quot;)]
    #[bitfield(name = &quot;year&quot;, ty = &quot;libc::c_short&quot;, bits = &quot;9..=23&quot;)]
    day_month_year: [u8; 3]
}

fn main() {
    let mut date = Date {
        day_month_year: [0; 3]
    };

    date.set_day(7);
    date.set_month(1);
    date.set_year(2020);

    assert_eq!(date.day(), 7);
    assert_eq!(date.month(), 1);
    assert_eq!(date.year(), 2020);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We are ABI compatible with C(<code>#1</code>) because we use a <code>struct</code> format with actual fields
and combine adjacent bitfields into a single byte array field. This format also allows for pointers
(and references) to be taken of non-bitfield fields, satisfying <code>#2</code>. Lastly, <code>#3</code> is satisfied by
having method generation boilerplate automatically derived from the macro with very little of it
user-facing.</p>
<p>The way this works is two-fold. Firstly, a transparent <code>c2rust-bitfields-derive</code> crate exports the
<code>BitfieldStruct</code> derive macro which handles all of the attribute parsing and method generation.
These generated methods assume the existence of a <code>FieldType</code> trait which is implemented for all
integer types as well as <code>bool</code>. It allows the generated code to determine whether a bitfield type
is signed, what is its total number of bits, and also provides internal getters and setters<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
Secondly, the <code>c2rust-bitfields</code> crate re-exports <code>BitfieldStruct</code> and provides the <code>FieldType</code>
trait and implementations.</p>
<p>Originally, this project only consisted of the <code>c2rust-bitfield</code> crate containing the derive macro code.
We then realized that we did not support booleans. So we added the <code>FieldType</code> trait which enabled
us to write more generic code over both integer and boolean types. However, the gotcha was that proc
macro crates can only export proc macros and nothing else. And so we had to split the crate in two
to account for this limitation (which might be removed in the future). Both crates are available on <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=c2rust-bitfields">crates.io</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bitfields-in-the-wild-nginx">Bitfields in the Wild: Nginx</h3>
<p>Adding bitfield support to C2Rust was necessary to successfully translate and compile
Nginx in Rust. One Nginx <code>struct</code> with bitfields looks like this in C:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">typedef struct {
    ngx_file_t file;
    off_t offset;
    ngx_path_t *path;
    ngx_pool_t *pool;
    char *warn;
    ngx_uint_t access;
    unsigned log_level:8;
    unsigned persistent:1;
    unsigned clean:1;
    unsigned thread_write:1;
} ngx_temp_file_t;
</code></pre>
<p>Rather than the last four fields being four unsigned ints in size(16 bytes on many platforms), it
only needs to occupy two bytes. And when transpiled into Rust, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">#[repr(C)]
#[derive(BitfieldStruct, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct ngx_temp_file_t {
    pub file: ngx_file_t,
    pub offset: off_t,
    pub path: *mut ngx_path_t,
    pub pool: *mut ngx_pool_t,
    pub warn: *mut libc::c_char,
    pub access: ngx_uint_t,
    #[bitfield(name = &quot;log_level&quot;, ty = &quot;libc::c_uint&quot;, bits = &quot;0..=7&quot;)]
    #[bitfield(name = &quot;persistent&quot;, ty = &quot;libc::c_uint&quot;, bits = &quot;8..=8&quot;)]
    #[bitfield(name = &quot;clean&quot;, ty = &quot;libc::c_uint&quot;, bits = &quot;9..=9&quot;)]
    #[bitfield(name = &quot;thread_write&quot;, ty = &quot;libc::c_uint&quot;, bits = &quot;10..=10&quot;)]
    pub log_level_persistent_clean_thread_write: [u8; 2],
    pub _pad: [u8; 6],
}
</code></pre>
<p>Interestingly, there are 6 trailing bytes for padding. This is necessary to be equivalent to the original
C <code>struct</code>. But the resulting struct is still 8 bytes(<code>16 - 2 - 6 = 8</code>) smaller than if bitfields were
not used.</p>
<h2 id="possible-crate-improvements-prs-welcome">Possible Crate Improvements (PRs Welcome!)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Big Endian architectures are not currently supported. They currently produce a hard compiler error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We currently only support the inclusive range format <code>..=</code> for the <code>bits</code> attribute param.
This means specifying a single bit looks like <code>7..=7</code>. We could support a single-digit value
or an alternative <code>bit</code> attribute param. The exclusive range <code>..</code> could also be supported.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="first-class-bitfield-support-in-rust">First-Class Bitfield Support in Rust?</h2>
<p>Josh Triplett <a href="https://youtu.be/l9hM0h6IQDo?t=1132">recently mentioned</a> that the FFI working group
is looking to explore Rust support for bitfields. A syntax for this might simply use attributes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">#[repr(C, packed)]

    #[bits(4)] month: libc::c_uchar,

    let mut date = Date {
        day: 0,
        month: 0,
        year: 0,
    };

    date.day = 7;
    date.month = 1;
    date.year = 2020;
