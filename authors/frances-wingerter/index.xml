      <description>tl;dr: c2rust (a transpiler from C to unsafe Rust) is once more being actively developed, now works with recent nightlies, has some new features and bugfixes, and has dropped the c2rust-refactor tool in preparation for an exciting new approach to generating safe rust. As always, we welcome new users and are eager for any feedback!
After a long while without much time or funding to dedicate to the project, c2rust is once more being updated and actively maintained by Immunant in collaboration with our friends at Galois.</description>
