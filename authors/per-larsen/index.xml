      <description>Memory management errors are responsible for 70 to 80 percent of security vulnerabilities1 2. This would be much less of a problem if computers were running more Rust and less (if any) C code.
So do we rewrite every widely used C project in Rust? Doing so entirely by hand is infeasible. Doing so in an entirely mechanized way is impossible. Between these extremes lies a point that strikes the optimal balance between the efficiency of automation and the intelligence of humans.</description>

      <description>It is obviously very bad if everybody used the same password. It is also bad when one person reuses the same password across sites. Luckily, we have password managers that can generate unique, random passwords for each site. It is no less of a problem when everybody runs the same software for the following reason: When a software flaw is found, we want every installation of the program to be different enough that the same malicious input cannot compromise multiple users (but not so different that users notice).</description>
